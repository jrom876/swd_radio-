EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE DEFINED RADIO

This experiment is a C++ OOP Software Defined Radio, complete with Transmitter, Receiver, and Antenna classes. 

There are also makefiles and shell scripts to compile and run it all with just a few keystrokes.

This is just a fun project I have been building in my spare time over the last year.

I will add unit tests in the near future.

It is EXPERIMENTAL (i.e. just for fun), and as such many parts are unfinished.


BACKGROUND:

I originally wrote much of this RF modeling software several years ago to help me with the development of ground penetrating radar systems.
