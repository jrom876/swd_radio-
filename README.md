EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE DEFINED RADIO

This project is a C++ OOP Software Defined Radio, complete with Transmitter, Receiver, and Antenna classes. 

I wrote this version in my spare time over the last year.

There are also makefiles and shell scripts to compile and run it all with just a few keystrokes.

I will add unit tests in the near future.

It is EXPERIMENTAL (i.e. just for fun), and as such many parts of it are unfinished.

BACKGROUND:

This RF modeling software was originally written several years ago to help me in the development of ground penetrating radar systems.
