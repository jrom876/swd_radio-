EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE DEFINED RADIO FRAMEWORK

This ongoing project is the framework for a C++ Object Oriented Software Defined Radio. It will mathematically model a radar transceiver and antenna, but the algorithms can be applied to many other types of radios.

There are also makefiles and shell scripts to compile and run it all with just a few keystrokes.

Unit tests will be added in the near future.

DISCLAIMER:

Only the Transmitter section has anything resembling developed code. Everything else is just untouched cut-and-paste code from other projects.

It is EXPERIMENTAL (i.e. just for fun), and as such many parts are unfinished and untested, there are tons of mistakes that need correction, and the code is subject to sudden and nebulous change.


BACKGROUND:

I originally wrote much of this RF modeling software several years ago to help me with the development of a ground penetrating radar system.
