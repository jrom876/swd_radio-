EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE DEFINED RADIO

This ongoing project is a C++ Object Oriented Software Defined Radio. It mathematically models a radar transceiver and antenna, but the algorithms can be applied to many other types of radios.

There are also makefiles and shell scripts to compile and run it all with just a few keystrokes.

Unit tests will be added in the near future.

DISCLAIMER:

It is EXPERIMENTAL (i.e. just for fun), and as such many parts are unfinished and untested, there are tons of mistakes that need correction, and the code is subject to sudden and nebulous change.


BACKGROUND:

I originally wrote much of this RF modeling software several years ago to help me with the development of a ground penetrating radar system.
